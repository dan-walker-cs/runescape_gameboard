=============
Tile Updates
=============
Frontend
- Each team tab needs its own endpoint
- New

Backend
- Could render N tabs on the Board page - 1/team
    - Tab Name = team name
    - Only display players from the dropdown belonging to that team
    - Players could switch views to see other teams' progress
    - Option 1:
        - Data Requirements:
            - completed & reserved information must move to rel_tile_player [new table]
                - tile_id
                - player_id
                - is_completed
                - is_reserved
                - NO id, active, created_dt, updated_dt
            - TileResponse still good for Objectives, minus old fields
            - New Response object required that looks similar to current TileResponse - with tile & player data
                - string teamName;

            - Board GridTiles do not change
            - Tile display data will now be built from tile, rel_tile_player
    - Option 2:
        - Data Requirements:
            - team
                - id, event_id, name
            - rel_team_player
                - id, team_id, player_id
            - rel_team_tile
                - id, team_id, tile_id, is_reserved, reserved_by, is_completed, completed_by
            - getTilesByTeam
            - Downside: Not dynamic, tiles will have to be inserted into the DB per team per event (not a big deal)
                - If I build an event-maker type interface eventually, this can be done through UI - like everything else config-wise
