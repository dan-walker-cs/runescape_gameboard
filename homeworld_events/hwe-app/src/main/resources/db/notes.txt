Tile Updates
=============
Frontend
- If a Tile's weight = 0, hide checkboxes & save button
- Determine how to mark connected Warp Tiles without using fill-color directly.
    - Outlines? Icons?
    - Use frontend to store warp tile information. No real need for reusability.

Backend
- Could render N tabs on the Board page - 1/team
    - Tab Name = team name
    - Only display players from the dropdown belonging to that team
    - Players could switch views to see other teams' progress
