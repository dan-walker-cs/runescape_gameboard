=============
Tile Updates
=============
Frontend
- Each team tab needs its own endpoint
- Endpoint / API audit
    - Come up with only necessary endpoints

Backend
- Could render N tabs on the Board page - 1/team
    - Tab Name = team name
    - Only display players from the dropdown belonging to that team
    - Players could switch views to see other teams' progress
    - Data Requirements:
        - tile
            - remove is_reserved, reserved_by, is_completed, completed_by
        - rel_event_player
            - remove team_name
        - team
            - id, event_id, name + audit
        - rel_team_player
            - id, team_id, player_id + audit
        - rel_team_tile
            - id, team_id, tile_id, is_reserved, reserved_by, is_completed, completed_by + audit
        - getTilesByTeam
        - Downside: Not dynamic, tiles will have to be inserted into the DB per team per event (not a big deal)
            - If I build an event-maker type interface eventually, this can be done through UI - like everything else config-wise
